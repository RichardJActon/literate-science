# Stylistic Critique or Difference of Opinion

- Have I phrased something poorly?
	- Please suggest an alternative, and link to the original with the commit.
- Have I organised some information poorly and structuring things differently might help with comprehensibility?
	- The more specific the better - "section X was confusing" is a bit too vague to be very useful
- Have I rubbed you the wrong way with an opinionated take and you've fallen v
ictim to [XKCD 386 syndrome](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png)?
	- Let me know but keep it civil ;)
