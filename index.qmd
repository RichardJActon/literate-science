## Literate Science

*A new paradigm for academic publishing*

__This is currently very much a work in progress and may change dramatically and rapidly, some sections may be drafts, outlines and bullet points to be filled in and properly edited as I go__

## Summary

I have two main proposals:

__Literate Publishing__ - An Open Source academic authoring, publishing and review platform which provides reproducible analyses by linking data, computation and results

__Review Bounties__ - a new business model for academic publishers

### Literate Publishing

### Review Bounties
